# Question

Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve("Inside promise").then(console.log);
console.log("Outside promise");
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer

The outside promise prints first because async codes comes after sync code.

The inside promise does not print first. It's important to remember that promises always come after synchronous code
