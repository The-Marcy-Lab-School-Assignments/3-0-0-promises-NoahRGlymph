# Question

Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve("Inside promise").then(console.log);
console.log("Outside promise");
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer

The inside promise should print first because it is being resolved.

The inside promise does not print first. It's important to remember that promises always come after synchronous code
